# *To-Do List*
A To-Do List iOS application written in Swift that gives a user the ability to create items which they are able to tick off once completed. Categories are implemented using an additional screen which allows users to sort their items into different categories based on areas, for example, Groceries. Persistent storage is implemented by using Realm which persists between app closures and dynamic colour schemes and theming are created by using the Chameleon Framework.

## *To Run:*
Open the workspace in Xcode/AppCode and deploy the application to a simulator or iOS device.

## *What I Learned:*

* The Swift programming language syntax and structre
* Creating an iOS app interface using Xcode/AppCode
* Using TableViewController within Swift
* Implementing persistant storage in Swift by using Realm

_**Please ignore excessive comments within this Project. I use them as a way to learn when implementing a new project, as I find it improves my retention of programming language concepts and language syntax when they are used .**_ üññüèª
