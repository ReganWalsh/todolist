# *To-Do List*
A To-Do List iOS application written in Swift that gives users the ability to create categories for list of to-do items such as 'Groceries', 'Work' and 'Personal' and creates to-do items within each of the categories.

## *To Run:*
Open the workspace in Xcode/AppCode and deploy the application to a simulator or device.

## *What I Learned:*

* The Swift programming language syntax and structre
* Creating an iOS app interface using Xcode/AppCode
* Using TableViewController within Swift
* Implementing persistant storage using Swift by using Realm

_**Please ignore excessive comments within this Project. I use them as a way to learn when implementing a new project, as I find it improves my retention of programming language concepts and language syntax when they are used .**_ üññüèª
